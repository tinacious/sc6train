				<h2>Choosing a Web Browser</h2>
				<p>
					For Windows users, the SiteCore Content Management System (CMS) recommends using Internet Explorer 8 or higher. If you are running an older version of Internet Explorer, please update to Internet Explorer 8 or 9. You can check your version of Internet Explorer in the Help&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; About menu. If you do not see a toolbar, press Alt on your keyboard to display it. To update Internet Explorer, click <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie/home/">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are on Mac, use the most recent version of either Safari or Firefox. To update Firefox, click <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2Ffx%2F%23desktop&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEezXQ_WQyi5k2c3rrmLFytEbZc7w">here</a>. If Safari is outdated, it can be updated by running Software Update on your Mac. You may experience timeouts with Google Chrome on a slow server.

				<h2>What's New in SiteCore 6</h2>
				<p>
					You may already be familiar with the Content Editor and Desktop views. New in version 6 is the Page Editor view. Page Editor view allows you to edit the site while browsing. It is similar to and replaces the Web Edit option.
				</p>
				<p>
					In SiteCore 6, the ribbon is new. The ribbon replaces the Floating Menu in previous versions of SiteCore.
				</p>
				<img src="img/ribbon.png" alt="The ribbon can be expanded by clicking any of the tabs or the arrow in the far right.">
				<!-- <img src="img/lock-item.png" alt="Clicking Edit checks out / locks the item for editing."> -->
				<p>
					The Breadcrumb has been renamed to Navigation Bar in this version of SiteCore. If you do not see the Navigation Bar, click the <u>View</u> tab and mark the box for the Navigation Bar. It should appear.
				</p>
				<img src="img/enable-nav-bar.png" alt="In the View tab, selecting the Navigation Bar checkbox displays the Navigation Bar (previously called Breadcrumb) and gives you the option to Edit the page in the Content Editor">
				<!-- <p>
					Clicking the second one—the one in the Navigation Bar—will take you to the Content Editor. When you click the first one, nothing happens. This appears to be a bug in Page Editor view. 
				</p>
				<img src="img/edit-buttons.png" alt="Clicking the second Edit button will take you to the Content Editor."> -->
				<p>
					Also new in SiteCore is the Floating Palette in Page Editor view. Clicking into an editable content block will make the Floating Palette appear.
				</p>
				<img src="img/floating-palette.png" alt="Floating Palette in Page Editor view">
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Editing a Page in Page Editor View</h2>
				<p>
					You can click on the editable content areas to edit the page. Not all areas of the page are editable, and often you can only edit blocks of text and image references, not their layout and arrangement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you login to the SiteCore Page Editor, you can navigate to the page you want to edit to edit it. You will need to double click to navigate from Page Editor view. Once you are at the page, hovering your mouse around the page will indicate which content blocks are editable by highlighting these areas with a dotted outline. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To edit text, simply click in an editable area and begin typing. Click the <u>Save</u> icon when you are done.
				</p>
				<img src="img/page-editor-save.png" alt="Once you are done, click the Save icon">
				<h3>Copying and Pasting: Removing Text Formatting</h3>
				<p>
					In Page Editor view, you will need to use the rich text editor pop-up by clicking the <u>Edit the Text</u> icon in the Floating Palette—it's the first icon on the left that looks like a Document sheet. This is indicated by the <span class="pink">pink arrow</span> in the screenshot below.
				</p>
				<p>
					Copying and pasting text from a rich-text source like Microsoft Word, an email, or a website may negatively affect the default Sheridan website layout.
				</p>
				<!-- <img src="img/strip-format.png" alt="Click on the clipboard with a W to paste without formatting."> -->
				<p>
					If you are copying and pasting from email, Microsoft Word or another website, you must use the <u>Paste from Word, strip font</u> button in the rich text editor to paste a plain text version without the formatting. It is the clipboard icon with a W. This is indicated by the <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span> in the screenshot below.
				</p>
				<img src="img/ce-popup.png" alt="Clicking the Document icon brings up the Content Editor pop-up where you can paste without formatting.">
				<p>
					When you click the <u>Paste from Word, strip font</u> button, another window will pop up. Paste your rich text in that box by either clicking Ctrl + V (Windows) or Cmd + V (Mac) or right clicking and selecting Paste from the context menu. Click the <u>Paste</u> button once your text is pasted. The window will close and your text will be pasted without formatting.
				</p>
				<img src="img/pasted-rich-text.png" alt="Paste text in the window and click Paste to paste it without formatting.">
				<p>
					Once you are finished in the rich text editor, click <u>Accept</u> to add the changes and close the rich text editor. You should now see your changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Click the <u>Save</u> icon in the top left corner, indicated by the <span class="pink">pink arrow</span>. It will ask you to confirm your changes. Click OK. If you are finished editing, you can close the Page Editor by clicking <u>Close</u>. This does not log you out. If you would like to close and logout, click the <u>Log off</u> button in the ribbon, indicated by the <span class="turq">turquoise box</span>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/save-logoff-close.png" alt="Save, Log off and Close buttons">
				<!-- <p>
					If you need more options than the Page Editor provides, you can do one of the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Click the <u>Document icon</u> in the floating palette in the Page Editor to load the rich text editor in a pop-up window (first image below)</li>
					<li>Click the <u>View</u> tab and check off the <u>Navigation Bar</u> box to display the navigation bar.
						<ul>
							<li>Click <u>Edit</u> to be taken to the full Content Editor (second image below)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/doc-icon.png" alt="Content Editor pop-up loads after clicking the Document icon."> -->
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Creating Headings and Subtitles</h2>
				<p>
					If you need to create headings/subtitles, you will need to go into the rich text editor as explained above. Select the text you want to change and apply a header style from the paragraph style dropdown menu. You can use Heading 3 or 4. The default style is "Normal" and "p" and should be used for all body text. The dropdown menu is indicated by a <span class="pink">pink arrow</span> and the text that will be affected is indicated by the <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/headings.png" alt="Highlighted text formatting will change based on the style chosen.">

				<h2>Creating Links: Linking to Files and Pages</h2>
				<h3>Internal Links and Linking to Documents</h3>
				<p>
					Internal links are links that link to other pages that reside on the Sheridan website. Linking throughout the Sheridan site can be done through the Page Editor. Simply select some text and click the Insert Link button on the floating palette. The Internal Link window will pop up. From here, you can navigate to the page you want to link to.
				</p>
				<img src="img/internal-link.png" alt="Highlight text, click the link button and the Internal Link window will pop up.">
				<p>
					The link button is indicated by the <span class="pink">pink arrow</span> and the desired page we want to link to is indicated by the <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span>. Press the <u>Link</u> button to add your link and close the window. Click <u>Save</u> to save your changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					To link to a document (PDF, DOC, PPT, etc.), you will need to upload it to the Media Library first. This is explained in the next section. You would link to a document the same way you would link to an internal page.
				</p>
				<h3>External and E-mail links</h3>
				<p>
					A hyperlink is another way of saying link. There are a variety of links/hyperlinks that you can create. We will only be creating external links and e-mail links.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to provide a link to an external website address or an email address link, you will need to click the <u>Document</u> icon to be taken to the rich text editor. The <u>Document</u> icon is the first button on the left in the Floating Palette. 
				</p>
				<p>
					An external link is a link that goes to another website. An e-mail link is a link that once clicked will load your default email client to send an email to the specified email address.
				</p>
				<p>
					After clicking the Document icon in the Floating Palette, you will see the rich text editor. From here, click the link button with a globe on it to open the hyperlink manager.
				</p>
				<p>
					Select the correct tab of the type of link you would like to create. In the image below, we are creating a hyperlink. Different options will be visible for the different types of links.
				</p>
				<p>
					Properly creating links is important. Improperly creating links can cause 404 Page Not Found errors. Using the hyperlink manager will properly create these links for you so it is important that you use it create the type of link you want.
				</p>
				<h4>External Links</h4>
				<p>
					Select the text you would like to make into a link and click the link button.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>URL</b>: This is the address of the link. All external links must be preceded by <code>http://</code> </li>
					<li><b>Link text</b>: This is the text that you highlighted before clicking the link button. This text will be clickable</li>
					<li><b>Target</b>: This is the window that it will appear in. None leaves it at the default which is the current window. If you want it to open in a new window, select New Window as the target. You can ignore the other options.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Press OK to add your link and then press Accept to add your changes. Click Save to save your changes.
				</p>
				<img src="img/ext-links.png" alt="Click Edit Text then Hyperlink Manager to manage external and email links.">
				<h4>E-mail Links</h4>
				<p>
					All email links must be preceded in their code by <code>mailto:</code> in order to function properly. Setting up the link using the E-mail tab will do this for you. Press OK to add the link. Press Accept to add your changes. Click Save to save your changes.
				</p>

				<h2 id="uploading">Uploading Images to the Media Library</h2>
				<p>
					Files will need to be added to the Media Library <em>before</em> being able to insert them into your pages. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is recommended to add images to the Media Library through Page Editor view as doing it this way will add it to the correct folder/directory for that section.
				</p>
				<h3>Uploading media from the Page Editor view</h3>
				<p>
					To access the Media Library from Page Editor view, navigate to the page you want to edit and click into an editable content area.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the floating palette, click the image icon, which is indicated in the following image with a <span class="pink">pink arrow</span>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-page-editor.png" alt="Add images in Page Editor view using the floating palette.">
				<p>
					Once you click the image icon, you will have the chance to upload an image to add in this content block or choose from already uploaded images. To select an already uploaded image, navigate to it and click the <u>Insert</u> button. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Uploading and Inserting images are two different steps. You must first upload an image before you can insert it. If your image is already uploaded, you can insert it.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your image is not uploaded yet, navigate to the folder you want to upload it to and click the <u>Upload</u> button. A small box will pop up and from here you can add an image. Click <u>Browse</u> to select an image from your computer. Click <u>Upload</u> to upload it to the Media Library.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you only want to upload images and not add them to a content block, you can access the Media Library through the Content Editor. To enter the Content Editor from Page Editor view, click on <u>Edit</u>. See the <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span> in the above image. See the following section for more information.
				</p>
				<img src="img/image-upload.png" alt="Uploading an image while in Page Editor view using the floating palette.">
				<h3>Uploading media from the Content Editor view</h3>
				<p>
					If you reached the Content Editor from Page Editor view, you will see a split-pane version. The Media Library can be accessed through the bottom toolbar in the Content Editor or through the menu accessible using the blue menu at the top right corner of the page. Both are indicated by <span class="pink">pink arrows</span> in the following image.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the Media Library from the Content Editor is useful to see all media, not just page-specific media.
				</p>
				<img src="img/split-pane-ce.png" alt="Split-pane view of the Content Editor and the site. The Content Editor is in the top pane.">
				<p>
					Navigate to the folder you want to upload files to then click <u>Upload Files</u>. You can upload images, PDF, Word documents and Flash files (SWF).
				</p>
				<img src="img/media-lib.png" alt="The Media Library">
				<p>
					If you do not see the left sidebar section as in the image above—the Content Tree—enable it by clicking the <u>View</u> tab in the top toolbar then checking off the box for <u>Content Tree</u>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/view-tab.png" alt="The View tab that allows you to choose which sections of the Content Editor are visible.">
				<p>
					Navigate to the folder/directory you want to upload the file to then click <u>Upload Files</u>. Choose the files you want to upload.
				</p>
				<h3>Uploading Multiple Files</h3>
				<p>
					You can upload more than one file at a time by holding different buttons on your keyboard and clicking on the files with your mouse.
				</p>
				<p>
					To select a range of files, click the first file in the range of files, press Shift, and then select the last file in the range. This will select all the files between the first file clicked and the last file clicked.
				</p>
				<img src="img/select-range.png" alt="Selecting a range of files involve clicking the first file, pressing and holding Shift, then clicking the last file.">
				<img src="img/select-mult.png" alt="Selecting multiple files not in a range can be done by simply holding the Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) button while clicking additional files.">
				<p>
					To select multiple files that are not in a range, click on the first file, then press Control (Ctrl, Windows) or Command (Cmd, Mac) and click all the files after that that you want to include while holding Control or Command.
				</p>
				<p>
					These are operating system-wide shortcuts that work in all instances of Windows Explorer and Mac Finder.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Setting Image Properties (Alt, width, height)</h2>
				<p>
					Click the Image icon (indicate by the <span class="pink">pink arrow</span>) to choose an image. If it is not in the Media Library, Upload it. Once the image is selected you will have the opportunity to modify the image properties. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two image properties that you should consider: 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Image width and height (scale)</li>
					<li>Alt Text</li>
				</ol> 
				These are indicated by a <span class="turq">turquoise rectangle</span> in the image below.
				<img src="img/img-attr-pe.png" alt="Image Attributes (Properties) in the Page Editor">
				<p>
					Change the image scale size here. Adjusting the scale size in this box immediately at insert will automatically maintain the desired aspect ratio. See the following image. 
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-scale-first.png" alt="Scaling an image down by simply changing the width. Height scales automatically if inserted this way. Original on the left, scaled on the right.">				
				
				<h3>Setting Image Scale Size (Width and Height)</h3>
				<p>
					If images have already been inserted and you need to adjust their size, click on <u>Edit this text</u> (the icon that looks like a document). From the Rich Text Editor pop-up, right click on the image and click Properties.
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-scale.png" alt="Setting the image scale size in the Image Properties section in Page Editor's Rich Text Editor.">
				<p>
					Unfortunately, when modifying the image size after inserting, the aspect ratio will not be conserved by default. <em>You must click the icon of the chain so that it appears closed in order to maintain the aspect ratio.</em> This icon is indicated by a <span class="pink">pink arrow</span>. After clicking the chain link icon, type in your desired width or height. The other will adjust automatically. This is indicated by a <span class="turq">turquoise rectangle</span>. A maximum scale width of 600px and height of 500px is recommended.
				</p>
				<p>
					Changing the width and height values will disrupt the original aspect ratio of the image. <em>It is advised only to modify these values to scale an image down in size</em>. Changing these values simply scales the image. It does not reduce or increase the image size, it simply stretches or squishes it. If you have large images, it is recommended that you shrink these using image editing software. See the section <a href="#editing-images">Editing Images for SiteCore</a> for instructions.
				</p>
				<h4>Scaling Images by Dragging</h4>
				<p>
					In this version of SiteCore, dragging image corners is a supported method for resizing images. <em>Drag images by the corner</em> to resize them while maintaining their aspect ratio. Dragging by the sides will not maintain their aspect ratio.
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-scale-drag.png" alt="Dragging an image by the corner in Page Editor will resize it while maintaining its aspect ratio.">
				
				<h3>Alternate Text</h3>
				<p>
					Once you upload an image, you will be taken to a screen where you can specify its attributes. <em>The only attribute you should add is the Alt text</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Alt" (alternate) text is the text that appears if the image does not appear, be it because images are disabled or the link path to the image is broken. It is also used by screen readers for users who are visually impaired. A short description of the image should be added here to assist users who cannot see images. It is good practice to include the alternate text. A red warning will appear next to the field indicating that it should be added if it is blank. This warning label only appears in the Content Editor.
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-attr.png" alt="Media Library from the Content Editor. Alternate text has not been added. Red indicates recommended field to complete.">
				<img src="img/img-alt-text.png" alt="Media Library from the Content Editor. Alternate text is included with this image. This is the right way.">
				<p>
					You do not need to modify any other image attributes. 
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-warn.png" alt="You can edit image attributes (like alt text) by clicking into the image. A warning indicates that the Alt text has not been added.">
				<p>
					Once you upload media you <em>must</em> publish it otherwise it will result in a broken link. To do so, click on Publish in the ribbon and Publish item. Save and Close.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Changing/Replacing Images in Page Editor</h2>
				<p>
					Some images can be changed/re-referenced but some cannot. Click on the image, then the image icon to change the source image. A box will pop up allowing you to upload an image from your computer or choose from one of your uploaded files. Uploading images using Page Editor view have been described in the previous section. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The window that pops up is a smaller view of the Media Library called the Media Browser. The difference between the Media Library and the Media Browser is the presentation: the Media Browser is presented in a pop-up window in Page Editor view. You will have access to all of the media uploaded to this section rather than the full Media Library.
				</p>
				<img src="img/img-page-editor.jpeg" alt="Editing images in Page Editor view.">
				<p>
					It is recommended that you do not use SiteCore for image editing (cropping, resizing, etc.) and that you instead use photo editing software like Photoshop. See the section <a href="#editing-images">Editing Images for SiteCore</a> for instructions.

				<h2>Saving, Submitting and Publishing Changes</h2>
				<p>
					After an item is edited and before an item can be published, it must move through the workflow.
				</p>
				<h3>Workboxes and Workflows</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Workbox</b>: Pages you have privileges to edit will be available in your Workbox.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Workflow</b>: A workflow is the process a document follows in order to be published.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Your changes will not be visible right away. They need to be approved by someone with more privileges.
				</p>
				<img src="img/publish-not-visible.jpg" alt="Changes saved will not be live right away. The document moves up in the workflow. (Content Editor view)">
				<p>

				<h2>The Content Editor View</h2>
				<p>
					In some cases you may need or prefer to edit in the Content Editor, e.g. if you need to see the Content Tree. To get the full Content Editor, it is recommended to log out and then log back in using Content Editor view. Unfortunately, there is no other way to access the full Content Editor at this time.
				</p>
				<h3>Content Editor at a glance</h3>
				<p>
					See the numbered list and image below for a quick reference of the Content Editor.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Main toolbar with multiple tabs. Each tab has its own set of options. <u>Save</u> and <u>Edit</u> appear on all tabs.</li>
					<li>Content Tree of the Media Library</li>
					<li>Content area. If you are browsing through the Media Library, you will see folders. If you open a file, you will see the file's information.</li>
					<li>Quick menu at the top right to quickly access the <u>Content Editor</u>, <u>Workbox</u> and <u>Media Library</u>.</li>
					<li>Bottom toolbar to quickly access the <u>Content Editor</u>, <u>Workbox</u> and <u>Media Library</u></li>
				</ol>
				<img src="img/quick-view.png" alt="Quick reference for SiteCore Content Editor">
				<h3 id="content-tree">About the Content Tree</h3>
				<p>
					You may find it useful to view all the pages and files in a hierarchical tree-like structure as if you were browsing files in Windows Explorer on your Windows computer (or Finder’s list and column views on Mac). In the Content Editor, click on the View tab and check the box for Content Tree and the site tree/map will show up in a left-hand sidebar.

				<h3>Uneditable Text in Page Editor</h3>
				<p>
					In Page Editor view, you may come across a content block that you cannot edit. It may be that: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the text is hard-coded into the site design and cannot be changed through the CMS</li>
					<li>it is a related item that resides elsewhere on the site and is fed in dynamically</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Unless you are editing the Admissions, Services and About Sheridan pages, you should not need to worry about this and will most likely be able to edit all content areas in the Page Editor.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the image below, we are trying to edit the Sheridan at a Glance section. We cannot edit it from Page Editor view so we must click the <u>More</u> button on the Floating Palette and click <u>Edit the related item</u>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/related-item.png" alt="Related item on the About Sheridan page">
				<p>
					Once you have clicked <u>Edit the related item</u>, you will see a split-pane view with the Content Editor in the top pane and the site content in the bottom pane, as shown in the image below.
				</p>
				<img src="img/split-pane.png" alt="Split-pane view of the Content Editor on the site.">
				<p>
					<!-- Related items that are dynamically fed in from different parts of the site require the Content Editor to edit.  -->Below is an example of what the Content Editor in the top pane contains. It has been expanded vertically so you can see more. Normally it is the size of the above image.
				</p>
				<img src="img/content-editor.jpeg" alt="Content Editor view of the related item that feeds onto the Admissions page but resides elsewhere on the site, i.e. in the Table of Contents area of the site.">
				<p>
					Edit the fields as desired and click <u>Save</u>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The items in the content editor are displayed in a content tree layout. You can navigate to the item you wish to edit and click on the Edit button then the Edit option (this locks the item to you for edits). Make your changes and press SAVE. Click Edit again and unlock the page by pressing <u>Check In</u> or submit it through the workflow to be approved by pressing <u>Submit</u>. Remember that if you just check the page in and do not submit it at some point, the changes will not be updated. You or someone else will have to eventually submit this page to move it through the workflow in order for the changes to appear.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are editing a right sidebar/column item, there will be a checkbox that indicates to include this section in the right-hand sidebar. This area is the <em>only</em> area it can go. Unchecking this box will simply hide it. If you do not want to display it but you do not want to delete it either, just remove the checkmark and save. The right sidebar/column content is indicated by the <span class="pink">pink arrow</span> and the checkbox to make it appear is indicated by the <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span>. In the image below it is selected so this item will appear.
				</p>
				<img src="img/right-sidebar.png" alt="Editing the right column/sidebar section in the Content Editor">
				<p>
					Once you save your changes in the split-pane view, you will be returned to Page Editor view where you can resume navigating and editing pages.

				<h2>Creating a Page</h2>
				<p>
					In the event that you need to create a page, you must login under Content Editor—it is not recommended to create pages from Page Editor view.
				</p>
				<p>
					Navigate to the login page again and choose Content Editor. In the Content Tree, navigate to the section you want to create a new page in and select it. Selecting a page will create a new item nested under the selected one. The selected page is indicated with a <span class="pink">pink arrow</span>. The new item will be nested under this section. You can create a new section by selecting the insert method <u>Rich Text</u>. You can do this from the top toolbar or the right click menu. Both are indicated with a <span class="turq">turquoise arrow</span>.
				</p>
				<img src="img/create-new.png" alt="A new rich text item will be created under second_career. It will be at the same nesting level as application_process, admission_to_sheridan, etc.">

				<h2>Versions</h2>
				<p>
					SiteCore tracks changes to pages under the Versions tab. You can edit from, revert back to, delete or hide a previous version. 
				</p>
				<img src="img/versions.png" alt="Versions button under the Versions tab in the Content Editor.">
				<p>
					From here you can remove/delete a version of the page. You can also compare versions and see the changes between the two. Changed sections are marked in red.
				</p>
				<img src="img/versions2.png" alt="Compare two versions in two-column layout.">
				<p>
					If you only want to unpublish/hide a version but not delete it, go to the Publish tab and click on <u>Change</u>. A window will pop-up allowing you to uncheck versions of the page to unpublish it.
				</p>
				<img src="img/versions3.png" alt="Version control under the Publish tab.">
				<p>
					You can also use this section to have a version only published for a certain amount of time. For example, if you have a 1-week special event happening in a month, you can create the content now, set it to be published at a later date, and have that version expire after the event is over.

				<h2>Editing Images for SiteCore</h2>
				<p>
					If your image is too large, you <em>must</em> shrink it with image editing software. Larger images take longer time to upload. If you adjust your image sizes ahead of time using software, you don't need to set the scale size in SiteCore.
				</p>
				<p>
					SiteCore comes with some image editing capabilities but it is recommended that you do not use them as they can be somewhat buggy. You may already have the Adobe Creative Suite installed on your computer. It is recommended that you use Photoshop or a free equivalent like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gimp.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFOjaxDa-fqxmtDG1SucNGBXFQHAQ">GIMP</a> or the online <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffotoflexer.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHMZJUUciRQ4uIhYpfsNbLl8qr_DQ">FotoFlexer</a>.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#photoshop">Photoshop</a> (or GIMP) software</li>
					<li><a href="#fotoflexer">FotoFlexer</a>: online, no download required (recommended for beginners)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="photoshop">Cropping and Resizing Images in Photoshop</h3>
				<p>
					Manually crop your images with Photoshop’s crop tool or specify a crop width and height.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resize your images without cropping: Go into Image > Image Size, or simply press Cmd+Alt+I (Mac) or Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows).
				</p>
				<img src="img/photoshop.png" alt="Crop tool in the left-hand tool palette (left) and Image Size tool in a floating window (right).">
				<p>
					Make sure the Constrain proportions box is checked off. A chainlink will show up to show that width and height are now linked. The image will skew and maintain the aspect ratio.
				</p>
				<h3>Optimizing Images for Web</h3>
				<p>
					This step isn't absolutely necessary but it reduces the file size so that the page loads faster.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you are happy with your image and you are ready to upload it, it’s time to save it in a web-friendly format. Go into File and click on Save for Web &amp; Devices. You can opt for a high-quality JPEG (for photographs and most graphics) or PNG-24 (for graphics with transparency). 
				</p>
				<img src="img/photoshop2.png" alt="Saving for web &amp; devices.">
				<p>
					When saving for web and devices, you will be given the option as to which format you would like to use. If you are using photographs, a high quality JPEG will suffice. PNG-24 are ideal for high quality graphics, especially if they require transparency support. PNG are somewhat larger in file size than JPEG and therefore take slightly longer to load. Most of the time, JPEG will work just fine. Choose your preferred format (JPEG vs. PNG), leave the default settings and press Save.
				</p>
				<h3 id="fotoflexer">Shrinking Images in FotoFlexer</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffotoflexer.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHMZJUUciRQ4uIhYpfsNbLl8qr_DQ">FotoFlexer</a> is an online tool used to edit images. No downloads are requierd. This software is ideal for beginners who want to edit images.
				</p>
				<img src="img/fotoflexer.png" alt="Fotoflexer is an online image editor">
				<p>
					To get started, click the <u>Upload</u> button. You'll be taken to another screen with another Upload button. Click that too. Select the image from your computer. The file will upload and you will be taken to the editor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only editing you will need to do is <span class="pink">cropping</span> or <span class="turq">resizing</span>, indicated below.
				</p>
				<img src="img/fotoflexer2.png" alt="Once an image is uploaded to Fotoflexer, it is ready for editing.">
				<h4>Resizing in Fotoflexer</h4>
				<p>
					The default image size in our example is 1280 x 800 pixels. This is too large. Ideally we don't want images to be larger than 600 pixels wide. The size of the area we are working with is 700 pixels wide. We don't want to use anything this size or larger. Click the <u>Resize</u> button to resize the image.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Resize tab will open showing the current dimensions. Adjust the width accordingly. The height will automatically adjust to constrain the aspect ratio. Make sure the <u>Keep Proportions</u> box is checked. Ideally images would be no larger than 600 pixels wide. Click <u>Apply</u> to apply the new size.
				</p>
				<img src="img/fotoflexer-resize.png" alt="Resize tab in Fotoflexer">
				<h4>Cropping in Fotoflexer</h4>
				<p>
					Cropping will allow you to trim the photo if you wanted to only use part of it and not the whole thing. In our example, let's say we only want to keep the green mountains. We would crop it to that area. Click <u>Crop</u> to use the crop tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Select the area you would like to keep then click <u>Crop Selected Area</u>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Note: You can see the dimensions of the photo in the top left corner while you drag the crop tool around the image. This can assist you in finding a good size for the image.
				</p>
				<img src="img/fotoflexer-crop.png" alt="The crop tool in Fotoflexer">
				<h4>Saving Your New Image</h4>
				<p>
					Once the image has been resized and cropped, you must save it to your computer's hard drive in order to upload it to SiteCore. Click the <u>Save</u> button. You'll be taken to a new screen where you can select the file format. JPG is ideal unless your image is a graphic that needs transparency. Click <u>Save to my Computer</u>. Name your new file and click <u>Save Now</u>. You will be asked to select a location to download the file. If you are not prompted to choose a location, it will download to your default downloads folder.
				</p>
				<img src="img/fotoflexer-download.png" alt="Downloaded photo from Fotoflexer on the right. Original on the left.">

					Your photo is now ready to be added to SiteCore. Please see the <a href="#uploading">Uploading Images</a> section for instructions.

				<h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
				<p>
					Below are some advanced tips that power users may find useful. This section is supplementary reading for those who would like to make the most out of SiteCore.
				</p>
				<h3>Closing and Reopening the Page Editor for faster browsing</h3>
				<p>
					Navigating to different portions of the site using the Page Editor can be slow depending on the speed of the server or your connection. You can close the Page Editor by clicking the Close button.
				</p>
				<img src="img/close-page-editor.png" alt="Close button under the Home tab section.">
				<p>
					Once you are on the page you want to edit, you will notice you are no longer in the Page Editor. To get to the Page Editor again, simply add the following text to the end of the URL in the address bar of your browser and hit Enter/Return. You must be logged in for this to work.
				</p>
				<code>
					?sc_mode=edit
				</code>
				<img src="img/url.png" alt="Once logged in, quickly edit the page in Page Editor view by adding text to the URL.">
				<p>
					Once you reload the page with the aforementioned URL suffix, Page Editor will be enabled on this page and you will be able to modify its editable content blocks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Remembering this little snippet of text will allow you to painlessly navigate the site and load the Page Editor only when needed, provided that you are logged in.
				</p>
				<h3>Quickly Accessing the Content Editor</h3>
				<p>
					Page Editor view is great for navigating and editing small blocks of content but if you find that you want to quickly access the content editor, add the following text after <code>/sitecore/</code> to the URL. 
				</p>
				<code>
					shell/Applications/Content%20Manager/
				</code>
